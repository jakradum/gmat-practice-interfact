      "title": "Vietnam's Economic Transformation",
      "content": "IT IS A contrarian argument from an improbable contrarian. Vietnam's economy may be the envy of South-East Asia, having averaged 6% annual growth over the past 15 years, but it is in urgent need of radical reform. So, at any rate, asserts To Lam, who spent eight years running Vietnam's ruthless security services before becoming general secretary of the Vietnamese Communist Party last year. He is busy sacking civil servants and amending economic laws in pursuit of a \"revolution\" to \"liberate all productive forces\". \"Time does not wait for us,\" he warned his comrades soon after taking charge.\n\nVietnam's economy has come a long way since the Vietnam war ended 50 years ago, leaving an already poor country in ruins. At first the victorious communist regime tried to \"liquidate\" the private sector. Shortages, rationing and hunger followed. In the 1980s the Soviet Union's economic troubles meant less aid for Vietnam, exacerbating the malaise. Annual inflation reached 454% and half of Vietnamese were living in poverty. The death of one of Mr Lam's predecessors in 1986 paved the way for a new general secretary to legalise private enterprise and embrace market forces.\n\nDoi moi or \"renovation\" has been an astonishing success. Over the past 40 years GDP per person has increased 18-fold and poverty has plummeted. Foreign investors, attracted by Vietnam's cheap labour, political stability (it is a single-party, authoritarian state), proximity to Asian suppliers and generous incentives for manufacturing, have built lots of factories assembling consumer goods for export. A trade deal with America, accession to the World Trade Organisation and, more recently, multinationals' desire to diversify away from China have provided further reasons to invest.\n\nYet the forces that have propelled Vietnam's boom are slowing or reversing. The pool of cheap workers is dwindling and wages are rising. Instead of largely free trade with America, Donald Trump is threatening tariffs of 46%. It is getting harder to maintain good relations with both America and China, Vietnam's second-biggest trading partner. And there has been relatively little spillover from the foreign-owned factories to the rest of the economy. Vietnam risks becoming stuck as an assembly hub, adding little value to components manufactured elsewhere. Shifting onto a more promising developmental path will not be easyâ€”and Mr Lam is staking his tenure on it."
